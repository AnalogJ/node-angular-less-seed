#node-angular-less-seed
## Synopsis

This is a boilerplate application with for node with builtin support for the following frameworks:

- NodeJS
- Express
- AngularJS
- EJS Templating
- Bootstrap with Less


## Motivation

Since I hate the default Jade templating system that comes with Express, and Bootstrap is my goto design framework, I decided to create my own custom boiler plate, inspired by the [angular-express-seed](https://github.com/btford/angular-express-seed)

## Installation

Pull down the repository and call with Node app.js
